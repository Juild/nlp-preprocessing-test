U.S. stock futures edged slightly higher ahead of overnight trading Wednesday
following another down day in markets as investors digested inflation data
that showed price levels remained elevated in April.

Futures tied to the S&P 500 rose 0.3% after the index settled at 3,935.18, or
its lowest level since March 2021. The S&P 500 is down more than 17% in the
first 90 trading days of 2022, marking its second worst start to a year,
according to data from Compound Capital Advisors. Contracts on the Dow Jones
Industrial Average inched up 0.2% after a decline of 300 points, or just over
1% in the main session, and Nasdaq Futures advanced 0.3% after the tech-heavy
benchmark fell 3% during the trading day.

The moves build on a streak of sharp losses in equity markets and follow
April’s Consumer Price Index CPI out Wednesday, which showed an inflation
rate that held near a 40-year high despite a marginal pullback from the prior
month. Furthermore, the so-called core price index, which excludes the
volatile food and energy categories, came in higher than economists had
anticipated, stoking worries among investors that elevated prices may persist.

April’s snapshot of inflation across the U.S. comes as investors gauge how
aggressively the Federal Reserve will intervene to rein in rising price levels
via monetary tightening, including increases on interest rates. Uncertainty
around the central bank’s next move has spurred turbulence across risk assets,
sending all three major indexes to their lowest trading levels year-to-date.

“Inflation appears to be entrenched within many areas of the economy and
regardless if we have witnessed inflation peak, a persistently slow grind
lower will be more problematic for the Fed to simultaneously cool inflation
without tipping the economy into recession,” Charlie Ripley, a senior
investment strategist at Allianz Investment Management, said in an emailed
note Wednesday.

Cleveland Fed President Loretta
Mester-
yahoo-finance-transcript-may-2022-202300664.html told Yahoo Finance on
Tuesday that interest rate hikes of 50 basis points were likely in the next
two Federal Reserve policy-setting meetings, while leaving an increase of 75
basis points on the table as the central bank ramps up its inflation-
mitigation efforts.

“It's going to be challenging, no doubt, because there are things going on on
both the supply side and the demand side,” Mester said. “But the risks to
inflation remaining high get even more risky as we keep going because of
inflation expectations, so it’s really important we’re committed to doing what
we need to do.”

Peter Essele, head of portfolio management, Commonwealth Financial Network,
said if inflation levels out in the second half of the year, there will be
less pressure on the Fed to combat elevated price levels with aggressive
monetary policies, "which leaves open the possibility of a soft landing of the
economy as opposed to the crash and burn that markets have been pricing in as
of late."

"The second half of the year could be a strong period for equities and bonds
if inflation continues to moderate and the magnitude of interest rate hikes
come in under expectations," Essele said in a note. "Currently, investors are
pricing in a doomsday scenario with inflation and are missing the forest for
the trees."
