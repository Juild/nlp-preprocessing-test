PARIS, March 26 Reuters - The French government plans to file a criminal
complaint against home care group Orpea
ORP.PA
mistreatment of elderly patients, government minister Brigitte Bourguignon
said in a statement Saturday.

Following a month and a half investigation into the group's management and
financial practices, the government found "significant dysfunctioning in the
group's management, to the detriment of the care of its residents," according
to the health ministry.

It will also seek to recover public funds provided to the company after
uncovering possible irregularities in how they were used.

Contacted on Saturday, Orpea said it will issue a statement soon in response
to the government's plan to launch legal proceedings against it.

A book by independent journalist Victor Castanet in January made public claims
of severe failings in hygiene care in an Orpea home for elderly people in a
wealthy Paris suburb. The French group has repeatedly denied systemic
shortcomings.

The government is inspecting the country's 7,500 elderly care homes over the
next two years and plans to reinforce legal and accounting rules to better
regulate groups managing elderly care, with a view to better transparency over
the use of public funds, it said.
